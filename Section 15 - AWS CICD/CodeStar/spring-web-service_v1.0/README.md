Welcome to the AWS CodeStar sample web service
==============================================

This sample code helps get you started with a simple Java web service
deployed by AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CloudFormation.

What's Here
-----------

This sample includes:

* README.md - this file
* .ebextensions/ - this directory contains configuration files that
  allows AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy your Java service
* buildspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to build the web
  service
* pom.xml - this file is the Maven Project Object Model for the web service
* src/main - this directory contains your Java service source files
* src/test - this directory contains your Java service unit test files
* template.yml - this file contains the description of AWS resources used by AWS
  CloudFormation to deploy your infrastructure
* template-configuration.json - this file contains the project ARN with placeholders used for tagging resources with the project ID

Getting Started
---------------

These directions assume you want to develop on your local computer, and not
from the Amazon EC2 instance itself. If you're on the Amazon EC2 instance, the
virtual environment is already set up for you, and you can start working on the
code.

To work on the sample code, you'll need to clone your project's repository to your
local computer. If you haven't, do that first. You can find instructions in the AWS CodeStar user guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#clone-repo.

1. Install maven.  See https://maven.apache.org/install.html for details.

2. Install tomcat.  See https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/setup.html for
   details.

3. Build the service.

        $ mvn -f pom.xml compile
        $ mvn -f pom.xml package

4. Copy the built service to the Tomcat webapp directory.  The actual
   location of that directory will vary depending on your platform and
   installation.

        $ cp target/ROOT.war <tomcat webapp directory>

4. Restart your tomcat server

5. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in a web browser to view your service.

What Do I Do Next?
------------------

Once you have a virtual environment running, you can start making changes to
the sample Java web service. We suggest making a small change to
/src/main/java/com/aws/codestar/projecttemplates/controller/HelloWorldController.java
first, so you can see how changes pushed to your project's repository are automatically
picked up and deployed to the Amazon EC2 instance by AWS Elastic Beanstalk. (You can
watch the progress on your project dashboard.) Once you've seen how that works, start
developing your own code, and have fun!

To run your tests locally, go to the root directory of the sample code and run the
`mvn clean compile test` command, which AWS CodeBuild also runs through your `buildspec.yml` file.

To test your new code during the release process, modify the existing tests or add tests
to the tests directory. AWS CodeBuild will run the tests during the build stage of your
project pipeline. You can find the test results in the AWS CodeBuild console.

How Do I Add Template Resources to My Project?
------------------

To add AWS resources to your project, you'll need to edit the `template.yml`
file in your project's repository. You may also need to modify permissions for
your project's worker roles. After you push the template change, AWS CodeStar
and AWS CloudFormation provision the resources for you.

See the AWS CodeStar user guide for instructions to modify your template:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/how-to-change-project.html#customize-project-template

What Should I Do Before Running My Project in Production?
------------------

AWS recommends you review the security best practices recommended by the framework
author of your selected sample application before running it in production. You
should also regularly review and apply any available patches or associated security
advisories for dependencies used within your application.
